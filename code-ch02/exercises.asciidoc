==== Exercise 1

Determine which of these points are on the curve y^2^=x^3^+5x+7:

(2,4), (-1,-1), (18,77), (5,7)

==== Exercise 3

Handle the case where the two points are additive inverses. That is, they have the same x, but a different y, causing a vertical line. This should return the point at infinity.
